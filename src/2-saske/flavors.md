# Flavors

Flavors are described by a simple class:

    vrusi1: flavors
    vrusi2: tasteables

    flavor1: tasteable
    flavor2: observer

The class of vrusi1 is known as *vusyselbri*.

Note that flavor phenomena are observer-dependent, but the relationship
between flavors and tasteable objects is not; a tasteable object tends to have
a predictable, reliable taste experience due to biochemistry.


## Tastes

The following flavors are the basic tastes:

Lojban | International English
---|---
cpina | piquant
krumami | umami
kurki | bitter
salni | salty
slari | sour, acidic
titla | sugary, sweet


### Notes

Some of the basic tastes result from simple chemical reactions; {salni} arises
from {sodna} (alkaline) ions, and {slari} comes from {slami} molecules (acids)
producing excess {cidro} (H) ions.

Paraphrasing la lorxus, {salni} was introduced as a refinement because {silna}
can be any of the following edible salts:

* calcium citrate: slari
* lead acetate: titla
* magnesium sulfate: kurki
* sodium acetate: salci, slari
* sodium citrate: salci, slari
* sodium glutamate: salci, krumami

We may need a similar nuance for {kurki}, which may colloquially denote
certain odors as well as the basic taste of bitterness, and {cpina}, which has
a polysemous definition that could include non-capsaicin flavors.

Humans are willing to taste quite a few things. As such, the class of flavors
will probably never be closed.
