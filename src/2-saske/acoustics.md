# Acoustics

Acoustics is the study of waves vibrating in air.

## Music

The baseline does not have a verb for playing musical instruments. We start
with the [Hornbostel—Sachs
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel%E2%80%93Sachs), which gives
us a topology for classifying instruments in lieu of a schema. We take a
cladistic approach: each *selbri* will designate the most specific
Hornbostel—Sachs number which gives a common prefix for all of its
culturally-grounded examples, which might not correspond to any particular
instrument but will provide a culturally-neutral family of instruments.

*selbri* | HS prefix | HS family
---|---|---
kimbali | (111) | directly struck idiophones
janbe | (111.2) | percussion idiophones
skilofo, marmiba | (111.212) | percussion sticks
glokesi, virbafo | (111.222) | percussion plaques
marxaka | (112.1) | shaken idiophones
embira | (122.1) | comb idiophones
damri | (21) | struck membranophones
timpani | (211.11) | kettle drums
klavire | (314.122) | true board zithers
jgita | (32) | composite chordophones
kordu | (412.132) | free-reed aerophones
flani | (421) | edge-blown aerophones
xagri | (422) | reed aerophones
tabra | (423) | trumpets
termeni | (531.1) | theremins

There is one problematic *gismu*, {pipno}, which conflates many different
instruments in an ad-hoc manner. It doesn't give a prefix and I don't think it
can be fixed or saved.

I don't have a non-trivial class yet. They all belong to *terto'aselbri*,
where {terto'a} is merely an emitter of pitches. Yes, even idiophones like
drums and cymbals emit pitches, merely not ones described by harmonic series.

### Notes

We allow {kimbali} to take some responsibilities from {damri}. Otherwise
{damri} doesn't even have a single-digit prefix, since it mixes membranophones
and idiophones.

{siclu} might not belong here? I guessed it might have prefix (421.1).

Perhaps {te tonga} is the proper path for collecting instruments:

    te tonga: t3 emits tone t1 with frequency/pitch t2

What are the units for frequency/pitch?

What are {dansu} and {rilti}?

What is zgike2? An event?
