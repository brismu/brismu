# Acoustics

Acoustics is the study of waves vibrating in air.

## Music

The baseline does not have a verb for playing musical instruments. We start
with the [Hornbostelâ€”Sachs
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel%E2%80%93Sachs), which gives
us a topology for classifying instruments in lieu of a schema.

*selbri* | HS number
---|---
damri | drum (21), cymbal (111.142), gong (111.241)
kimbali | cymbal (111.142), gong (111.241)
flani | flute (421.2), pipe, fife (421.121.12), recorder (421.221.12)
janbe | bell (111.242), chime (111.232), tuning fork (111.211)
jgita | guitar (321.322), violin (321.322), fiddle (321.322), harp (322)
pipno | piano (314.122), harpsichord (314.122), synthesizer (53), organ
siclu | whistle (421.1)
tabra | horn (423.2), trumpet (423), trombone (423.22), bugle (423.121.22)
xagri | oboe (422.112), clarinet (422.211.2), saxophone (422.212)
termeni | theremin (531.1)
skilofo | xylophone (111.212)
marmiba | marimba (111.212)
embira | mbira (122.1)
glokesi | glockenspiel (111.222)
virbafo | vibraphone (111.222)
timpani | kettledrums (211.11)
marxaka | maracas (112.1)

{damri} must have a beater (11).

{janbe} produces a single resonant tone (1).

{jgita} must have a plectrum/bow (3).

{siclu} might not belong here?

{tabra} must be brass, wind, lip, or reed (42).

{xagri} must have reeds (422).

### Notes

Perhaps {te tonga} is the proper path for collecting instruments:

    te tonga: t3 emits tone t1 with frequency/pitch t2

What are the units for frequency/pitch?

What are {dansu} and {rilti}?

What is zgike2? An event?
